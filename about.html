I’m David, I live in Catania(IT) but I like to move for long periods and live in different cities.<br />
Maybe someone says I’m a designer but overall I’m a gamer.  </p>

<p>In 2012 I was in Florence and with a lot of other people I contributed to foundation of Fablab Firenze.
Than in Catania I’ve joined and ruled the Hackspace Catania that today I can call “Home”.
I started discovering this world in 2011 from 3D printing, a powerful tool for every product designer, and so it has become my thesis.  </p>

<p>For me the Fab Academy is an opportunity to extend my skills in digital fabrication and a way to find new reason to reach new cities.  </p>

<p>I really like games, especially boardgames and RPG.<br />
A game has usually a set of rules, some tool to play with and motivated people who decide to play the game.<br />
That’s a game for me.  </p>
