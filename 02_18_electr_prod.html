<p>On wednesday 02.18.2015 we’ve got the <a href="https://vimeo.com/119359648">fourth online lesson</a> with Neil Gershenfeld.<br />
The next lessons can be found on the <a href="http://vimeo.com/fabacademy">Fab Academy account on Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>Here some tutorials
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkLJI8L7TUs&amp;feature=youtu.be">FabLab Using the modela to Mill PCBs</a></p>

<p>For this week the assignment was  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>** make the FabISP in-circuit programmer **  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>(more informations can be found at the bottom of <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/electronics_production/index.html">this page</a>)</p>

<h2 id="set-up">Set up</h2>

<p>I referred to <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/content/projects/fabispkey/index.html">this</a> tutorial. It’s complete and clear.</p>

<p>Making circuit since here has revealed quite simple.<br />
It consist substantially of 4 steps: <strong>mill the board, solder the components, test the circuit and upload the firmware</strong>.
Every single step is quite simple, but requires a lot of attention because of the tiny dimension of what we use. For this reason setup, in my humble opinion, is the most important part of the job: if well done can reduce drastically mistakes and fixing.  </p>

<h3 id="milling">Milling</h3>
<p>With the fabmodules it’s very easy to use the MX-20, but you have to keep in mind just few things:  </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>set correctly the board at the base to have always the same height so the mill can work properly.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pay attention at the sound: it has to be constant and not too loud; if too loud check all the milling set up process.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you’re making a prototype, just one piece: don’t be hasty and you’ll make it just once (or maybe twice, not more).  </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Taking my time for the set up this has been the result at the first attempt.
Not bad.  </p>

<h3 id="soldering">Soldering</h3>
<p>One more time set up comes first.
Instead of search for the correct component from the blister every time I searched once at the beginning. To not mix components I’ve cut some slots to label with the relative component’s code.  </p>

<p><img src="./img/02_18_elect_prod/setup02.jpg" alt="setup02" />  </p>

<p>To optimize the operations I tied to my index a piece of solder to have it always ready, and it has revealed fairy comfortable.
That’s the quintessence of wearable device!! :D  </p>

<h3 id="upload-the-firmware">Upload the firmware</h3>

<p>To upload the firmware on the FabISP I need another ISP programmer to bridge the FabISP with computer trough a 6pins ribbon bus.<br />
I used the firmware used by Andy.</p>

<h2 id="what-ive-done">What I’ve done</h2>

<p>This  </p>

<p><img src="./img/02_18_elect_prod/fabispDM.jpg" alt="fabispDM" />  </p>

<p>That’s it.</p>

<h3 id="note">Note</h3>

<p>To program this FabISP you have to solder a jumper but on this version you have two jumpers; you have to solder the one closer to the micro-controller, not the other one near the keychain hole. If you solder the wrong jumper you simply wont be able to program the FabISP.  </p>
