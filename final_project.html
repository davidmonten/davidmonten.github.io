<p>A device to better manage our everyday time to help us to not overcommit our lives.<br />
A simple way to visualize and manage time from a different point of view.
A non invasive but strongly communicative device to tink about time as a discrete resource instead of a continuous flow.    </p>

<p>It count time as a percentage over an amount of time defined by the user instead of a delta between two moments. This way I can commit an amount of time to do something and monitor how much time left I have.  </p>

<p>Thinking about our everyday life we can easily recognize three main classes of tasks: duties, leisure and needs. These three categories are bounded by the following equation:</p>

<pre><code>Duties + Leisure &lt; 24h - Needs  
</code></pre>

<p>so each of them is a variable that everyone can set.
The residual amount for each variable is shown by three led bars, going always from 100% to 0% at different rates depending on the amount of time resource committed for each one.<br />
Two buttons to press simultaneously allow to swap from a variable to another.
When the current variable reach the 0% automatically the other two will be decreased at half of each rate until you wont choose which one is currently running; when also the second variable has reached the 0% the remaining variable continue to decrease at it’s own rate.   </p>

<h3 id="what-questions-need-to-be-answered">What questions need to be answered?</h3>

<p>Will it be a useful device?<br />
Will help me to better organize my time?<br />
How can it evolve?<br />
What function can easily be integrated using the same hardware?<br />
What functions can be integrated upgrading the hardware?<br />
How can it be optimized?<br />
Does people will build it? and why? or why not? </p>

<h3 id="whos-done-what-beforehand">Who’s done what beforehand?</h3>

<p>Everything starts from this an article I’ve read online some month ago.
<a href="https://hbr.org/2015/02/a-formula-to-stop-you-from-overcommitting-your-time">A Formula to Stop You from Overcommitting Your Time</a>  </p>

<p>This device will just show this simple principle overtime.  </p>

<p>Online I’ve found different watches with fancy displays, but the most counts on hours and minutes base, just because they are watches, and they don’t need to be configured but just synchronized with the local area time.<br />
The closer to my idea is the <a href="http://www.tokyoflash.com/en/watches/kisai/denshoku/">Kisai Denshoku</a> led watch because of its japan style minimalism, but even with a fancy visualization it still counts time as usual.  </p>

<p>Last example of minimal watches is the <a href="http://www.uniquewatchguide.com/worlds-smallest-nixie-watch-the-kopriso-mi-esposita/">Nixie watch</a> using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixie_tube">nixie tube</a></p>

<h3 id="board">Board</h3>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/board.jpg" alt="board" />  </p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/board2.jpg" alt="board2" />  </p>

<p>First of all I started designing the board because it will define the minimum space needed for the components.<br />
I started from a board made during the Output assignment and than I milled a more compact double layer board that measures 29.36x52.23x1.65 with 1mm round corners. At first attempt some traces where not well defined and the overall size of the battery case exceeded the edge of the board. </p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/oldboard_front.jpg" alt="oldboard_front" />  </p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/oldboard_back.jpg" alt="oldboard_back" />  </p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/boards_front.jpg" alt="boards_front" />  </p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/boards_rear.jpg" alt="boards_rear" />  </p>

<p>To avoid accidental pressures of the button I made an hardware double-button so the actual pressure is read just if both the physic buttons are pressed simultaneously.<br />
On the back side there are two pads to power the board with external power source because the energy issue is one of the main field for further developments.  </p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/schematic.png" alt="schematic" />  </p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/board_full_info.png" alt="board_full_info" />  </p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/top.jpg" alt="top" />  </p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/bottom.jpg" alt="bottom" />    </p>

<p><a href="./files/00_final_proj/board.7z">Board.7z</a>  </p>

<p>When I first mounted the FTDI slot it was parallel with the board, but goes outside the silhouette  of the board so I decided to bend it, paying attention to not touch the traces nearby, and direct the slot the bottom of the frame.<br />
Before to mount the buttons on the side of the board I manually removed the copper on the edge, otherwise the button would be constantly “pressed”.  </p>

<h3 id="frame">Frame</h3>
<p>The frame has to be sturdy, reliable, simple. This part can be made in two different ways and I tried both: 3D print and casting.  Due to its small size also tolerance and precision can’t be left behind.</p>

<p>First I designed the shape with 3D software starting from the overall size of the board components.</p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/case_wip1.jpg" alt="case_wip1" />  </p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/case_wip3.jpg" alt="case_wip3" />  </p>

<p>On the right side it has a slot for the button, on the left side a slot for the button and a slot for a microUSB plug for further implementation of lipo battery and easier connections.  </p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/case_right_side.jpg" alt="case_right_side" />  </p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/case_left_side.jpg" alt="case_left_side" />  </p>

<p>I made it first with 3D printer to verify shapes and dimensions and fix tolerances to fit properly; the first test has revealed some major mistake that doesn’t allow at all the fit of the two parts. After the first test I’ ve loosened the fit by 0.2mm and continued with more test.  </p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/first_failure.jpg" alt="first_failure" />  </p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/3dprint_test2.jpg" alt="3dprint_test2" />  </p>

<p>The upper shell has to be transparent, or in any case has to let the light pass through. For this reason I 3D printed this piece in Taulman T-glasse, the only material 3d-pintable that lets light pass trough itself.<br />
Otherwise I can make a double mold to cast a see-through resin.
To do so I made master milled from wax.<br />
The wax master needs much more attention because of the two shell and the long time needed to mill it. I first used a 3mm endmill to the rough finish and a 1.54 endmill for the fine finish.  </p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/mold_01.jpg" alt="mold_01" />  </p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/machining_wax5.jpg" alt="machining_wax5" />  </p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/making_silicone_molds.jpg" alt="making_silicone_molds" />  </p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/hightemp_mold2.png" alt="hightemp_mold2" />  </p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/molds.jpg" alt="molds" />  </p>

<p>At the first attempt I’ve got some trouble with the scale, so I don’t mixed the correct amount of pasts. The rsult was that the silicone after 24hrs were still liquid, so I poured it into a jar to redo the mold and at the second attempt it has came out well.  </p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/holes_test.jpg" alt="holes_test" /> </p>

<p>Due to its shape the lower shell can be made in an open mold. Moreover the lower shell doesn’t need to be transparent and so I decided to use a metal filled resin, but first I made a simple test to verify how a steel thread works on resin and how large the hole has to be. For an M3 screw a 2.4mm holes works well but a little bit tight while a 2.8mm holes can be threaded anyway, but it works smoother. I simply don’t know on the long run what’s the best but to avoid to overstress the resin matrix I’ll go with a 2.8mm and if the screw will loosen I’l put some teflon.  </p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/holes_test.jpg" alt="holes_test" />  </p>

<p>To mix filled resins it’s recommended to weigh the part A, than add the filler and than complete adding the part B to start the chemical reaction. If you want you can even control the weight of the object because the metal filler is far more heavy  than resin (from about 5 to about 7 times).</p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/metal_case_master.jpg" alt="metal_case_master" />  </p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/measuring_metalpoweder.jpg" alt="measuring_metalpoweder" />  </p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/holes_test.jpg" alt="holes_test" />  </p>

<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/holes_test.jpg" alt="holes_test" />   </p>

<p>I also produced 3d-printed version of the lower shell to compare the results. It has been made with different materials: with bronze filled PLA for a metallic warm finish and a good weight-feel, and carbon filled PLA for a light and strong structure in addition to simple PLA for test. </p>

###Design considerations  
* A game is essentially a set of rules that define one or more purposes, some ways to reach it and forbidden behaviours. All that is not inherent with the Fab Academy's purposes and will not be developed. The project will be about a framework of devices to use to write a set of rules.  

* That kind of game need a great amount of time to set up a match. That imply a great motivation and a long duration of the match to justify the setting time, so virtually this game could be infinite adding new space game, new planets, new fleet and new parties.  

* The planets will not be spherical but polihedrical to define a number of slot that can host pieces (like ships and buildings). The join between planet and pieces will be made by magnets, so it provides both an easy snap of the pieces and elettrical contact at the same time. The faces can be made in different material to customize the planet and even if the material is not transparent a light feedback will be visible trough not merged edges.  
 
* I'd like to have the main input and output information directly trough modules and use the webapp just for specific informations. So probably at least two faces of the polyhedron will be reserved to the main input and output functions.  

* The frame of the known space will be modular too to expand the space of the game.  

###Updates  

02.19.2015 - Yesterday during the review of Haldin Andres I've seen an interesting image about some pattern that I'd use over modules and pattern to customize a set of pieces.
![obrary](http://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/eu/students/haldin.anders/img/week3/living_hinge.jpg)
You can find dxf and pdf on a [github repository](https://github.com/Obrary/Living-Hinge-Swatches).  

I'll use also another pattern made by me to customize some piece.
I'm still working on it.

04.22.2015 - I've watched [this TEDx Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/eduardo_saenz_de_cabezon_math_is_forever?language=it) by Eduardo Saenzde Cabezon about math, and I found the Weaire-Phelan structure so interesting that I decided to add as a resource to this page.
This structure define how boubles ideally works filling the an amount of space with clusters with the minimum surface area.

04.25.2015 - I've just watched this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHwXlcHcTHc
where Stuart Brown, founder of the National Institute for Play (http://www.nifplay.org/) talks about the importance of play. He says that play is not just fun, it's a natural behaviour we tend to lost ageing, but it let us discover new way and solutions, learn things about the world around us, make social connections with all the animals (humans included) and set our mood in a positive way, letting us overcome easily daily issues (even at work).
All these things are not just fancy subjects, but are supported by nature observation, historical reconstruction and scientific demonstrations.
Any of us knows how to play and how to set thing like a game, but we just forget it to fit the society expectations of earnestness.
The most representative sentence (read on the Institute website) is: "the opposite of play is not work, is depression".
This source is not so pertinent to the development of this project, but it talks about the importance of playing even after childhood and youth.
