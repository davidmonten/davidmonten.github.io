<p><img src="./img/00_final_project/avatar_sketch.jpg" alt="avatar_sketch" />  </p>

<p>A device to better manage our everyday time to help us to not overcommit our lives.<br />
A simple way to visualize and manage time from a different point of view.
A non invasive but strongly communicative device to tink about time as a discrete resource instead of a continuous flow. </p>

<h3 id="what-will-it-do">What will it do?</h3>

<p>It count time as a percentage over an amount of time defined by the user instead of a delta between two moments. This way I can commit an amount of time to do something and monitor how much time left I have.  </p>

<p>Thinking about our everyday life we can easily recognize three main classes of tasks: duties, leisure and needs. These three categories are bounded by the following equation:</p>

<pre><code>Duties + Leisure &lt; 24h - Needs  
</code></pre>

<p>so each of them is a variable that everyone can set.
The residual amount for each variable is shown by three led bars, going always from 100% to 0% at different rates depending on the amount of time resource committed for each one.<br />
Two buttons to press simultaneously allow to swap from a variable to another.
When the current variable reach the 0% automatically the other two will be decreased at half of each rate until you wont choose which one is currently running; when also the second variable has reached the 0% the remaining variable continue to decrease at it’s own rate. </p>

<h4 id="further-developments">Further developments</h4>
<p>In further development I may integrate:<br />
- rechargeable lithium battery<br />
- less energy drain display<br />
- liquid cristal/oled display<br />
- subroutine to manage up to 5 tasks per category<br />
- gather statistics of habits and time commitment<br />
- make a good package  </p>

<h3 id="whos-done-what-beforehand">Who’s done what beforehand?</h3>

<p>Everything starts from this an article I’ve read online some month ago.
<a href="https://hbr.org/2015/02/a-formula-to-stop-you-from-overcommitting-your-time">A Formula to Stop You from Overcommitting Your Time</a>  </p>

<p>This device will just show this simple principle overtime.  </p>

<p>Online I’ve found different watches with fancy displays, but the most counts on an hour and minute base, just because they are watches, and they don’t need to be configured but just synchronized with the local area time.  </p>

<p>At the following link I’ve found a great website about data visualization

QUELLO CHE SI TROVA ALL'INTERNO DI QUESTO COMMENTO è LA PRIMA PROPOSTA DEL PROGETO FINALE, UN PROGETTO TROPPO COMPLESSO PER ESSERE REALIZZATO IN TEMPO, CON GLI STRUMENTI E LE COMPETENZE FORNITE IN QUESTO CORSO.
RESTA COMUNQUE UNA PROPOSTA VALIDA, MAGARI DA SVILUPPARE IN SEGUITO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A wargame set in outerspace with an interactive and modular scenario.  

![concept](/img/home/concept.jpg)  

###Subject
Every modules will be sensible to different kind of ships and will provide useful informations for an enhanced gameplay.
The game will allow to be played as a phisical game, being phisically immersed into the scenario to play the game and moving every piece by hand while the great part of the digital aspects will be "almost-unperceiveble".

###Design considerations  
* A game is essentially a set of rules that define one or more purposes, some ways to reach it and forbidden behaviours. All that is not inherent with the Fab Academy's purposes and will not be developed. The project will be about a framework of devices to use to write a set of rules.  

* That kind of game need a great amount of time to set up a match. That imply a great motivation and a long duration of the match to justify the setting time, so virtually this game could be infinite adding new space game, new planets, new fleet and new parties.  

* The planets will not be spherical but polihedrical to define a number of slot that can host pieces (like ships and buildings). The join between planet and pieces will be made by magnets, so it provides both an easy snap of the pieces and elettrical contact at the same time. The faces can be made in different material to customize the planet and even if the material is not transparent a light feedback will be visible trough not merged edges.  
 
* I'd like to have the main input and output information directly trough modules and use the webapp just for specific informations. So probably at least two faces of the polyhedron will be reserved to the main input and output functions.  

* The frame of the known space will be modular too to expand the space of the game.  

###Updates  

02.19.2015 - Yesterday during the review of Haldin Andres I've seen an interesting image about some pattern that I'd use over modules and pattern to customize a set of pieces.
![obrary](http://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/eu/students/haldin.anders/img/week3/living_hinge.jpg)
You can find dxf and pdf on a [github repository](https://github.com/Obrary/Living-Hinge-Swatches).  

I'll use also another pattern made by me to customize some piece.
I'm still working on it.

04.22.2015 - I've watched [this TEDx Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/eduardo_saenz_de_cabezon_math_is_forever?language=it) by Eduardo Saenzde Cabezon about math, and I found the Weaire-Phelan structure so interesting that I decided to add as a resource to this page.
This structure define how boubles ideally works filling the an amount of space with clusters with the minimum surface area.

04.25.2015 - I've just watched this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHwXlcHcTHc
where Stuart Brown, founder of the National Institute for Play (http://www.nifplay.org/) talks about the importance of play. He says that play is not just fun, it's a natural behaviour we tend to lost ageing, but it let us discover new way and solutions, learn things about the world around us, make social connections with all the animals (humans included) and set our mood in a positive way, letting us overcome easily daily issues (even at work).
All these things are not just fancy subjects, but are supported by nature observation, historical reconstruction and scientific demonstrations.
Any of us knows how to play and how to set thing like a game, but we just forget it to fit the society expectations of earnestness.
The most representative sentence (read on the Institute website) is: "the opposite of play is not work, is depression".
This source is not so pertinent to the development of this project, but it talks about the importance of playing even after childhood and youth.
