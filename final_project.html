<p>A wargame set in outerspace with an interactive and modular scenario.  </p>

<p><img src="/img/home/concept.jpg" alt="concept" />  </p>

<h3 id="subject">Subject</h3>
<p>Every modules will be sensible to different kind of ships and will provide useful informations for an enhanced gameplay.
The game will allow to be played as a phisical game, being phisically immersed into the scenario to play the game and moving every piece by hand while the great part of the digital aspects will be “almost-unperceiveble”.  </p>

<h3 id="design-considerations">Design considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A game is essentially a set of rules that define one or more purposes, some ways to reach it and forbidden behaviours. All that is not inherent with the Fab Academy’s purposes and will not be developed. The project will be about a framework of devices to use to write a set of rules.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That kind of game need a great amount of time to set up a match. That imply a great motivation and a long duration of the match to justify the setting time, so virtually this game could be infinite adding new space game, new planets, new fleet and new parties.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The planets will not be spherical but polihedrical to define a number of slot that can host pieces (like ships and buildings). The join between planet and pieces will be made by magnets, so it provides both an easy snap of the pieces and elettrical contact at the same time. The faces can be made in different material to customize the planet and even if the material is not transparent a light feedback will be visible trough not merged edges.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’d like to have the main input and output information directly trough modules and use the webapp just for specific informations. So probably at least two faces of the polyhedron will be reserved to the main input and output functions.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The frame of the known space will be modular too to expand the space of the game.  </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>02.19.2015 - Yesterday during the review of Haldin Andres I’ve seen an interesting image about some pattern that I’d use over modules and pattern to customize a set of pieces.
<img src="http://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/eu/students/haldin.anders/img/week3/living_hinge.jpg" alt="obrary" />
You can find dxf and pdf on a <a href="https://github.com/Obrary/Living-Hinge-Swatches">github repository</a>.  </p>

<p>I’ll use also another pattern made by me to customize some piece.
I’m still working on it.</p>

<p>continue to read the <a href="01_28_princ_n_prac.html">first assignment</a></p>

<p>04.22.2015 - I’ve watched <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/eduardo_saenz_de_cabezon_math_is_forever?language=it">this TEDx Talk</a> by Eduardo Saenzde Cabezon about math, and I found the Weaire-Phelan structure so interesting that I decided to add as a resource to this page.
This structure define how boubles ideally works filling the an amount of space with clusters with the minimum surface area.

<p>This is a good reading about Weaire-Phelan foam and Kelvin Foam

<p>Here a good tutorial about hot to 3d design a Weaire-Phelan structure in Rhino http://www.designcoding.net/weaire-phelan-structure/

<p>04.25.2015 - I’ve just watched this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHwXlcHcTHc
where Stuart Brown, founder of the National Institute for Play (http://www.nifplay.org/) talks about the importance of play. He says that play is not just fun, it’s a natural behaviour we tend to lost ageing, but it let us discover new way and solutions, learn things about the world around us, make social connections with all the animals (humans included) and set our mood in a positive way, letting us overcome easily daily issues (even at work).
All these things are not just fancy subjects, but are supported by nature observation, historical reconstruction and scientific demonstrations.
Any of us knows how to play and how to set thing like a game, but we just forget it to fit the society expectations of earnestness.
The most representative sentence (read on the Institute website) is: “the opposite of play is not work, is depression”.
This source is not so pertinent to the development of this project, but it talks about the importance of playing even after childhood and youth.</p>
