<p>On wednesday 03.11.2015 we’ve got the <a href="https://vimeo.com/121906120">sixth online lesson</a> with Neil Gershenfeld.<br />
The next lessons can be found on the <a href="http://vimeo.com/fabacademy">Fab Academy account on Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>For this week the assignment was  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>**
  read a microcontroller data sheet
  program your board to do something, with as many different programming languages and programming environments as possible **  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>This is one of the most important and complex classes, nothing impossible but surely it requires a little bit of effort more for me. Manage properly all the function of a micro controller will allow me to design interactions and program functions. To do so I could use some board like Arduino to make everything easy and fast; by doing so some process will stay behind a curtain.
Program a micro controller means to know its structure, how it is build inside, how it communicate with the outer world and what I can or can not do with it.<br />
At the end of this page what I’ll accomplish will be to blink a led, faster, slower, with a fade and other weird and pointless things…but that’s not the point. The real goal is to understand how a micro controller works to use it in my project and how to write code to give instructions to my micro controller.</em>  </p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<h3 id="files">Files</h3>

<p>When you <em>compile</em> a program you pick informations from different sources, merge it together and translate in binary code to let the micro controller to read it.  </p>

<p>In order to be compiled every program in C+ needs:<br />
a <strong>File.c</strong>:			it contains the informations about the algorithms you want the micro has to do. <br />
some <strong>Dependencies</strong>:	“pieces” of program your File.c refers to; some of their functions will be embeeded in the compiled file.
and<br />
a <strong>File.make</strong>:		it contains the “recepie” to “bake” the file that we want to compile, or the info to retrieve all the files (File.c and dependencies) to compile.  </p>

<p>Keep all the files in the same folder can be a smart choice to start avoiding any sort of issue.  </p>

<h3 id="microcontroller">Microcontroller</h3>

<p>I’ve used an ATtiny44.<br />
Here you can find the <a href="http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc8006.pdf">datasheet</a>, a detailed document about this device.  </p>

<p>Its main parts are:
<strong>Memory</strong><br />
there are three different kind of memory: flash, RAM and EEPROM; they are all subdivided in registers of 8 binary characters.  </p>

<p><strong>Clock</strong>
It sets the amount of cycle per second; the built-in is works at 8MHz, but you can overide it with an external clock.  </p>

<p><strong>Timers</strong>
It’s a counter and it counts events; it’s properly a timer when paired up with clock to have a time reference.  </p>

<p><strong>Interrupts</strong>
They stop the program that is running to do something else, than the main program restarts from where it was stopped; is cames in play, for example, when a button is pressed.   </p>

<p><strong>Input/Output Ports</strong>
ATtiny44 has group of 8 pins due to its 8bit structure. Every pin can be setted as input, output or none setting to 1 or 0 or floating the relative pin in the proper register.  </p>

<p><strong>Universal Serial Interface (USI)</strong>
It’s the main way it communicates with other devices.  </p>

<p><strong>Analog comparator</strong></p>

<p>Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)</p>
